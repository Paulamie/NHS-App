=>when u move on to next page should still have the same filter(tuesday)
=>ask why there is no icons 
=>fix the table sizing on the site for your page


To do List 16/03/2024:
=> Ayans has to update her code to make sure that the graphs are pulling the data from the 'Algorithm.csv" file (can you also make sure to add the side bar to the design please?)
=> Ken has to finish his report page 
=> Jana has to implement the error handling features to the upload feature, such as not allow the user 
to add a file that has more than 18 collumns (this is not allowed and will break the code so quite important).
=> Ana has to add the sidebar to the upload page and link the algorithm to the website so it runs when the website is ran. DONE

Ps: i changed the name of Algorithm2.csv to InputTest to avoid confusion.
