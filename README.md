connect your git to this 
git clone it same way u did for IOT =>press onto code then you will get link 
write this in terminal once you are connected 
git config --global user.name Your usergithubname               
git config --global user.email your.email@example.com

then you can easily git commit and push when you make any changes straight from VSCODEEEE

will check how to use branches and the pull request feature!!!!

for now please:)))))

place your html files in the templates folder 
for the backend just place your stuff in app.py remember to do this as it will be easily intergrated easily 
css files in static folder I think not sure forgotten it !!!

once we decide on a template we can use the inheritance thingy that Zaheer taught us last year. that way we can make sure that every page looks exaclty the same.
